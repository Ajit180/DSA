Certainly! This program `buildFromLevelOrderTraversal` is designed to construct a binary tree using level-order traversal input from the user. Let's go through it step by step:

### Function Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```cpp
   void buildFromLevelOrderTraversal(node* &root) {
   ```
   - This function takes a reference to a `node*` (`root`), which will hold the root of the constructed binary tree.

2. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   queue<node*> q;
   cout << "Enter data for root:" << endl;
   int data;
   cin >> data;
   root = new node(data);
   q.push(root);
   ```
   - Initialize a queue `q` of pointers to nodes (`node*`).
   - Prompt the user to enter data for the root node.
   - Create a new node with the entered data and assign it to `root`.
   - Push the root node onto the queue `q`.

3. **Tree Construction Loop**:
   ```cpp
   while (!q.empty()) {
       node* temp = q.front();
       q.pop();

       cout << "Enter left node for " << temp->data << ":" << endl;
       int leftdata;
       cin >> leftdata;

       if (leftdata != -1) {
           temp->left = new node(leftdata);
           q.push(temp->left);
       }

       cout << "Enter right node for " << temp->data << ":" << endl;
       int rightdata;
       cin >> rightdata;

       if (rightdata != -1) {
           temp->right = new node(rightdata);
           q.push(temp->right);
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Queue Processing**:
     - Dequeue the front node (`temp`) from the queue `q`.
     - Prompt the user to enter data for the left child of `temp`.
       - If `leftdata` is not `-1`, create a new node with `leftdata` and assign it as the left child of `temp`. Push this new node onto `q`.
     - Prompt the user to enter data for the right child of `temp`.
       - If `rightdata` is not `-1`, create a new node with `rightdata` and assign it as the right child of `temp`. Push this new node onto `q`.
   - Repeat the process until the queue `q` is empty.

4. **Explanation**:
   - This function constructs a binary tree level by level based on user input.
   - It uses a queue to keep track of nodes whose children need to be entered.
   - For each node processed (`temp`), it prompts the user to enter data for its left and right children.
   - If the user enters `-1` for a child node, it indicates that the child does not exist.
   - The function dynamically allocates memory for each new node and maintains proper linkage between nodes.

### Example Usage:

Suppose you input the following data during execution:
```
Enter data for root:
1
Enter left node for 1:
3
Enter right node for 1:
5
Enter left node for 3:
7
Enter right node for 3:
-1
Enter left node for 5:
-1
Enter right node for 5:
9
Enter left node for 7:
-1
Enter right node for 7:
-1
Enter left node for 9:
-1
Enter right node for 9:
-1
```

This would construct the following binary tree:
```
        1
       / \
      3   5
     /     \
    7       9
```

### Key Points:
- The function uses a queue for level-order processing, ensuring that nodes are processed in the order they appear.
- It handles dynamic memory allocation for nodes and properly links them based on user input.
- The function stops adding nodes to the queue once all levels of the tree have been processed, as indicated by the user input `-1` for both children of a node.

This approach is useful for creating binary trees from level-order input, where you can visually see the structure of the tree as it's being constructed level by level.
