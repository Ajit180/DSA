Certainly! The `levelordertraversal` function performs a level-order traversal (also known as a breadth-first traversal) on a binary tree. Let's break down the code step by step, especially considering the tree you mentioned:

### Tree Structure:

```
        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \   \
    7  11  17
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:

   ```cpp
   queue<node*>q;
   q.push(root);
   q.push(NULL);
   ```

   - A queue `q` is initialized to assist with the level-order traversal.
   - The root node (`1`) is pushed into the queue, followed by a `NULL` marker. This `NULL` is used to indicate the end of the current level.

2. **While Loop**:

   ```cpp
   while (!q.empty())
   ```

   - The loop runs as long as there are nodes in the queue.

3. **Process Each Node**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front();
   q.pop();
   ```

   - The front node of the queue is assigned to `temp` and removed from the queue.

4. **Check for Level Completion**:

   ```cpp
   if (temp == NULL)
   ```

   - If `temp` is `NULL`, it means we have completed processing all nodes at the current level.

5. **Level Completion Actions**:

   ```cpp
   cout << endl;
   if (!q.empty()) {
       q.push(NULL);
   }
   ```

   - Print a newline to separate levels.
   - If the queue is not empty (indicating there are more nodes to process in subsequent levels), push another `NULL` marker to denote the end of the next level.

6. **Process Non-NULL Nodes**:
   ```cpp
   else {
       cout << temp->data << " ";
       if (temp->left) {
           q.push(temp->left);
       }
       if (temp->right) {
           q.push(temp->right);
       }
   }
   ```
   - Print the data of the current node.
   - If the left child exists, push it to the queue.
   - If the right child exists, push it to the queue.

### Example Execution:

Given tree:

```
        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \   \
    7  11  17
```

Let's traverse this step by step:

1. **Initial Queue**: `[1, NULL]`
2. **Process Node 1**:
   - Print `1`
   - Push left child `3`
   - Push right child `5`
   - Queue: `[NULL, 3, 5]`
3. **End of Level 1**:
   - Encounter `NULL`
   - Print newline
   - Push `NULL`
   - Queue: `[3, 5, NULL]`
4. **Process Node 3**:
   - Print `3`
   - Push left child `7`
   - Push right child `11`
   - Queue: `[5, NULL, 7, 11]`
5. **Process Node 5**:
   - Print `5`
   - No left child
   - Push right child `17`
   - Queue: `[NULL, 7, 11, 17]`
6. **End of Level 2**:
   - Encounter `NULL`
   - Print newline
   - Push `NULL`
   - Queue: `[7, 11, 17, NULL]`
7. **Process Node 7**:
   - Print `7`
   - No left or right child
   - Queue: `[11, 17, NULL]`
8. **Process Node 11**:
   - Print `11`
   - No left or right child
   - Queue: `[17, NULL]`
9. **Process Node 17**:
   - Print `17`
   - No left or right child
   - Queue: `[NULL]`
10. **End of Level 3**:
    - Encounter `NULL`
    - Print newline
    - Queue: `[]` (empty)

Final Output:

```
1
3 5
7 11 17
```

This traversal ensures that each level of the tree is printed on a new line, and all nodes at the same level are printed together.



### How the temp and Queues null is working step by step:

Let's clear up the sequence of events in the level-order traversal to ensure we understand how `temp` can sometimes be `NULL` and sometimes not.

### Key Clarification:

- `temp` can be `NULL` after `q.pop()`, but only if the front of the queue was `NULL`.
- When we pop `NULL` from the queue, it signifies the end of a level.
- If the front of the queue is not `NULL`, we pop a node and process it in the `else` block.

### Step-by-Step Detailed Walkthrough:

Given the tree:

```
        1
       / \
      3   5
     / \   \
    7  11  17
```

### Initial Setup:

- Queue: `[1, NULL]`

1. **First Iteration**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front(); // temp is 1
   q.pop();                // Queue becomes [NULL]
   ```

   - `temp` is `1`, which is not `NULL`.
   - Execute the `else` block:
     ```cpp
     cout << temp->data << " ";  // Output: 1
     if (temp->left) q.push(temp->left);  // Push 3
     if (temp->right) q.push(temp->right); // Push 5
     ```
   - Queue: `[NULL, 3, 5]`

2. **Second Iteration**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front(); // temp is NULL
   q.pop();                // Queue becomes [3, 5]
   ```

   - `temp` is `NULL`.
   - Execute the `if (temp == NULL)` block:
     ```cpp
     cout << endl;  // Output: newline
     if (!q.empty()) q.push(NULL);  // Queue is not empty, push NULL
     ```
   - Queue: `[3, 5, NULL]`

3. **Third Iteration**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front(); // temp is 3
   q.pop();                // Queue becomes [5, NULL]
   ```

   - `temp` is `3`, which is not `NULL`.
   - Execute the `else` block:
     ```cpp
     cout << temp->data << " ";  // Output: 3
     if (temp->left) q.push(temp->left);  // Push 7
     if (temp->right) q.push(temp->right); // Push 11
     ```
   - Queue: `[5, NULL, 7, 11]`

4. **Fourth Iteration**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front(); // temp is 5
   q.pop();                // Queue becomes [NULL, 7, 11]
   ```

   - `temp` is `5`, which is not `NULL`.
   - Execute the `else` block:
     ```cpp
     cout << temp->data << " ";  // Output: 5
     if (temp->left) ;  // No left child
     if (temp->right) q.push(temp->right);  // Push 17
     ```
   - Queue: `[NULL, 7, 11, 17]`

5. **Fifth Iteration**:

   ```cpp
   node* temp = q.front(); // temp is NULL
   q.pop();                // Queue becomes [7, 11, 17]
   ```

   - `temp` is `NULL`.
   - Execute the `if (temp == NULL)` block:
     ```cpp
     cout << endl;  // Output: newline
     if (!q.empty()) q.push(NULL);  // Queue is not empty, push NULL
     ```
   - Queue: `[7, 11, 17, NULL]`

6. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Continue processing nodes `7`, `11`, and `17` similarly, updating the queue and outputting their values. Each `NULL` marker signifies the end of a level.

### Summary:

- When `temp` is `NULL`, we know we've reached the end of a level, and we handle it accordingly.
- When `temp` is not `NULL`, it means we're processing an actual node, and we handle its children.

The queue only contains `NULL` temporarily as a marker. After `q.pop()`, `temp` will be `NULL` only if the front of the queue was `NULL`. Otherwise, `temp` will be the next node in the queue, and the `else` block will execute.

Therefore, after popping a node (like `1` or `3`), `temp` is not `NULL`, and the `else` block executes. When we pop a `NULL`, it marks the end of the level, and we handle that in the `if (temp == NULL)` block.
