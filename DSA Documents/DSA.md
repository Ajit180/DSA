### Total Questions to Practice:
- **Around 300-350 questions** in total across all topics.
- Focus on **pattern recognition** rather than just solving random problems.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with basics** (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists) and gradually progress to harder topics like **Dynamic Programming**, **Graphs**, and **Trees**.
- Practice questions from **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **Codeforces**, or **HackerRank**.
- Prioritize **solving problems from different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)** to gradually increase confidence.
- Regularly revisit previously solved problems to see if you can optimize solutions or apply different techniques.

This approach will give you a strong foundation and enough variety to feel confident in DSA!
